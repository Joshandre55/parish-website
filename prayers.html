<h2>PRAYERS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2>
<p>

<h2>COMMON PRAYERS</h2>
<h3>THE SIGN OF THE CROSS</h3>
In the name of the Father, and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
<h3>OUR FATHER<h3>
Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed
be Your Name. Your Kingdom come.
Your Will be done, on earth as it is in
Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread. And
forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
those who trespass against us. And lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us
from evil. Amen.
<h3>HAIL MARY<h3>
Hail Mary, Full of Grace, The Lord is with
you. Blessed are you among women,
and blessed is the fruit of your womb,
Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us
sinners now, and at the hour of death.
Amen.
<h3>GLORY BE TO THE FATHER</h3>
Glory be to the Father and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning, is now, and
ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
<h3>THE APOSTLES’ CREED</h3>
I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth, and in
Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He
was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and
born of the Virgin Mary.
He suffred under Pontius Pilate, was
crucifid, died and was buried. He
descended into hell. On the third day He
rose again. He ascended into heaven,
and is seated at the right hand of God
the Father Almighty. He will come again
to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy
Catholic Church, the communion of
saints, the forgiveness of sins, the
resurrection of the body, and life
everlasting. Amen.
<h3>THE NICENE CREED</h3>
I believe in one God, the father Almighty,
maker of heaven and earth, of all things
visible and invisible. I believe in one
Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten
son of God, born of the Father before
all ages. God from God, light from light,
true God from true God, begotten, not
made, consubstatial with the Father;
through him all things were made.
For us men and for our Salvation he
came down from Heaven, and by the
Power of the Holy Spirit was incarnate
of the Virgin Mary, and became man.
For our sake He was crucifid under
Potious Pilate, he suffred death and
was buried, and rose again on the third
day in accordance with the scriptures.
He ascended into heaven and seated
at the right hand of the Father. He will
come again in glory to judge the living
and the dead and His Kingdom will
have no end.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the
giver of life, who proceeds from the
Father and the Son, who with the Father
and the Son is adored and glorifid,
who has spoken through the prophets.
I believe in one Holy Catholic and
Apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism
for the forgiveness of sins and I look
forward to the resurrection of the dead
and the life of the World to Come. Amen
<h3>HAIL HOLY QUEEN</h3>
Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our
life, our sweetness, and our hope. To
you do we cry, poor banished children
of Eve. To you do we send up our sighs
mourning and weeping in this valley
of tears. Turn then, most gracious
advocate, your eyes of mercy toward
us, and after this our exile show us the
blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus. O
clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
<h3>THE FATIMA PRAYER</h3>
O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save
us from the fie of hell, lead all souls
to heaven, especially those who are in
most need of your mercy.
<h3>PRAYER BEFORE MEALS</h3>
Bless us O Lord, and these your gifts,
which we are about to receive, from
your bounty, through Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
<h3>MORNING OFFERING</h3>
O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart
of Mary, I offr you my prayers, works,
joys, and suffrings of this day in union
with the holy sacrifie of the Mass
throughout the world. I offr them for
all the intentions of your sacred heart:
the salvation of souls, reparation for
sin, the reunion of all Christians. I offr
them for the intentions of our bishops
and of all the apostles of prayer, and in
particular for those recommended by
our Holy Father this month.
<h3>EVENING PRAYER</h3>
O my God, at the end of this day I thank
you most heartily for all the graces I have
received from you. I am sorry that I have
not made a better use of them. I am
sorry for all the sins I have committed
against you. Forgive me, O my God,
and graciously protect me this night.
Blessed Virgin Mary, my dear heavenly
mother, take me under your protection.
St. Joseph, my dear guardian angel, and
all you saints of God, pray for me. Sweet
Jesus, have pity on all poor sinners, and
save them from hell. Have mercy on the
suffring souls in purgatory.
<h3>ACT OF CONTRITION</h3>
O my God, I am heartily sorry for having
offnded You and I detest all my sins,
because I dread the loss of heaven and
the pains of hell, but most of all because
they offnd You, my God, who are all
good and deserving of all my love. I
fimly resolve, with the help of thy grace,
to confess my sins, to do penance, and
to amend my life.
<h3>PRAYER AFTER MASS</h3>
Soul of Christ, make me holy. Body of
Christ, save me. Blood of Christ, fil me
with love. Water from Christ’s side, wash
me. Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
Good Jesus, hear me.
Within your wounds, hide me. Never let
me be parted from you. From the evil
enemy, protect me. At the hour of my
death, call me, and tell me to come to
you that with your saints I may praise
you through all eternity. Amen.
<h3>PRAYER TO THE GUARDIAN ANGEL</h3>
Angel of God, my guardian dear, to
whom God’s love commits me here,
ever this day, be at my side, to light and
guard, rule and guide. Amen.
<h3>ETERNAL REST</h3>
Eternal rest, grant unto them (him/her),
O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon them
(him/her).
May they (he/she) rest in peace. Amen.
<h3>ANGELUS</h3>
The Angel of the Lord declared to Mary
and she conceived by the power of the
Holy Spirit.
Hail Mary…
Behold, I am the hand maid of the Lord,
be it done to me according to your
word.
Hail Mary…
And the word was made flsh and dwelt
among us.
Hail Mary…
Pray for us o Holy mother of God, that
we may be worthy of the promises of
Christ.
Let Us Pray
Pour forth we beseech you O Lord, your
graces into our hearts, that we to whom
the incarnation of your son Jesus Christ
was made known by the message of an
angel may be brought by his passion,
through the same Christ our Lord,
AMEN.
<p>
<h3>CATENA LEGIONIS</h3>
<p>
Who is she that comes forth as the
morning rising,
 <p>
fair as the moon, bright
as the sun, terrible as an army set in the
battle array?
<p>
My soul glorifis the Lord and my spirit
rejoices in God my savior.
<p>
He looks on his servant in her lowliness
hence forth all angels will call me
blessed.
<p>
The Almighty works marvels for me
Holy his name.
<p>
His mercy is from age to age on those
who fear him;
<p> 
he puts forth his arm in
his strength and scatters the proud
hearted.
<p>
He casts the mighty from their thrones
and raises the lowly.
<p>
He fils the starving with good things
and sends the rich away empty.
<p>
He protects Israel his servant
remembering his mercy, 
<p>
the mercy promised to his fathers, to Abraham
and his sons for ever.
<p>
Glory be to the father, and to the son,
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the
beginning, it is now and ever shall be,
world without end, AMEN.
<p>
Who is she that comes forth as the
morning rising, fair as the moon, bright
as the sun, terrible as an army set in the
battle array?
<p>
O Mary conceived without original sin,
pray for us who have recourse to you.
<p>
Let Us Pray
<p>
O Lord Jesus Christ, our mediator with
the father.
You have been pleased to appoint the
most blessed virgin, your mother to
be our mother also and our mediatrix
with you, mercifully grant that whoever
comes to you, seeking your favours may
rejoice to receive all of them through
her, AMEN.

<h3>THE HOLY ROSARY</h3>

mysteries (fie decades), the “Hail
Holy Queen” is said
<p>
Hail, holy Queen…
<p>
Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.
That we may be made worthy of the
promises of Christ.
<p>
The following prayer may be added after
the “Hail, Holy Queen”
<p>
Let us pray.
<p>
O God, Whose Only-Begotten Son, by
His life, death and resurrection, has
purchased for us the rewards of eternal
life: grant, we beseech you, that by
meditating upon these mysteries of the
most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin

the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
